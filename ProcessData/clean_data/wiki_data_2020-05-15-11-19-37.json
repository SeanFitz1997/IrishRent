The term has now morphed into use as a metonym for the Irish financial services industry as well as being used as an address and still being classified as an SEZ.\nIt officially began in 1987 as an SEZ on an 11-hectare docklands site in central Dublin, with EU approval to apply a 10% corporate tax rate for \"designated financial services activities\" on the site. Before the expiry of this EU approval in 2005, the Irish Government legislated to effectively have a national flat rate by reducing the overall Irish corporate tax rate from 32% to 12.5% which was introduced in 2003.An additional primary goal of the IFSC was to assist the urban renewal and development programme of the North Wall area as a result of its dereliction following the advent of containerisation in the 1960s. The area continues to benefit from Section 23 (Urban Renewal) income tax reliefs for property owners as of 2019 although new entrants ceased being able to avail of reliefs from 1999.The original 11-hectare IFSC site has gone through several expansions to become a 37.8-hectare area by 2018 which is now a major European financial centre situated within Dublin's central business district. By merging with the Spencer Dock and Grand Canal Dock (sometimes called Silicon Docks) area, the IFSC is now considered to be an \"International Services Centre\", covering a broader range then being purely \"financial\". The creation and development of the IFSC is considered by author Nicholas Shaxson to be an important part of Ireland's economic growth story.A 2015 Irish Government IFS 2020 Strategy Paper, lists the Irish financial services sector as comprising over 400 companies, employing over 35,000 people (one third outside Dublin), with over \u20ac3.2 trillion in funds under administration, providing \u20ac2bn in taxes and \u20ac2.3bn in wages and salaries. KMPG estimate the IFSC constitutes 7% of Irish GDP. The IFSC has now become one of Europe's most important centres for \u00a7 Fund Administration & Domiciling, and \u00a7 Securitisation, and ultimately became the birthplace of and global leader in \u00a7 Aircraft leasing.Some of the largest offices in the IFSC are those of the major Irish accounting and law firms. They have become associated with the creation and development of international tax management tools, (such as the Double Irish, Single malt, and Capital allowances for intangible assets (CAIA) BEPS tools; and Section 110 SPV, QIAIF and ICAV zero-tax legal structures), leading to concerns of Ireland as a tax haven. In 2017, a University of Amsterdam study estimated that the IFSC was one of the world's largest Conduit OFCs for facilitating global corporate tax avoidance.

Up until June 2014 Castletroy and neighbouring suburbs were not within the city boundary despite being part of the cities overall urban fabric.  The amalgamation of the 2 local authorities in Limerick from 2014 saw all areas of Limerick (city and county) come under one united and single authority for the first time. The merger of the authorities saw the city area expanded to include all urban areas (including Castletroy) within the Limerick urban area into the Limerick Metropolitan District within the merged Limerick authority.\nAlso in Castletroy is a small and little-known Jewish graveyard. It dates from the late 19th century when Limerick had a sizable Jewish community and was renovated and reopened by Chief Rabbi Mervis in 1990. Limerick's Jewish population waned over the decades, though a sizable portion of Jews lived in Castletroy as late as the 1980s.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==", "image": "Castletroy.jpg"}, "Dooradoyle": {"summary": "Dooradoyle (Irish: Tuar an Daill) is a large suburb of Limerick, Ireland.
